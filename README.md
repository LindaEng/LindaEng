As a software engineer with a strong passion for design and functionality, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my technical skills and knowledge. I have extensive experience with technologies such as React.js, Redux, Express, Tone.js, and PostgreSQL, and am always looking for ways to deepen my understanding of these tools. Additionally, I am eager to learn more about CSS animation and audio programming, as I believe these skills would greatly enhance my ability to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

In my free time, I enjoy producing house music and going on long bike rides around NYC. These activities allow me to tap into my creative side and find inspiration for my work as a software engineer. I believe that a well-rounded and balanced approach to my professional and personal interests allows me to bring a fresh perspective to my work and stay motivated and engaged.<br><br>
