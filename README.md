### Hello World! 👾💾

I build learning tools powered by data and machine learning.  
My focus is on turning messy information into clear, usable experiences that help people actually learn.

I work across the stack with **React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS**, and I’m especially interested in how models, feedback loops, and system design come together in real products—not demos.

Right now I’m exploring applied ML through hands-on projects and learning **Elixir and Phoenix** to better understand scalable, real-time systems.

Outside of engineering, I produce house music and bike around NYC.
